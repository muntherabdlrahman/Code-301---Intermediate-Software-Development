*Like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life. She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn’t a good match.*
 
 
 
 #### Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corpoious opportunities — Internet companies, a Ph.D. program — but nothing seemed exactly right. So in 2009, she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.

- When Rozovsky arrived on campus, she was assigned to a study group carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds. Study groups have become a rite of passage at `M.B.A`. programs, a way for students to practice working wasn’t `like that for me.’’`

- Instead, Rozovsky’s study group was a source of stress. ‘‘I always felt like I had to prove myself,’’ she said. The end who got to represent the group in class. `‘‘People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other,’’` Rozovsky told me. ‘‘I always felt like I had to be careful not to make mistakes around them.






### Who is Roy Fielding?
***Radiant MLHub Python Client was released in March 2021. You can use the client to search data on Radiant MLHub and easily download them to your Python environment. Checkout our tutorials repository on GitHub for Jupyter Notebook examples for using the Python Client***.

- Radiant Earth is developing the Geospatial Machine Learning Model Catalog (GMLMC) specification. GMLMC will empower repositories of ML models that users can access to find existing ML models for various geospatial applications. If you are interested in this topic, checkout GMLMC on GitHub to explore the ways you can contribute to it.

### Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
> ***Andrew Ng, founder of the Google Brain Deep Learning project, feeds a neural network using deep learning algorithms 10 million YouTube videos as a training set. The neural network learned to recognize a cat without being told what a cat is, ushering in breakthrough era for neural networks and deep learning funding.***

Look, we've been talking about this with a lot of abstraction. How about we take a real example. Imagine you are a teacher - at school you probably have a big computer system, or three or four computer systems more likely, that would let you manage students: what classes they're in, what grades they're getting, emergency contacts, information about the books you teach out of, etc. If the systems are web-based, then there's probably a URL for each of the nouns involved here: student, teacher, class, book, room, etc. Right now, getting the URL through the browser gives you a web page. If there were a machine readable representation for each URL, then it would be trivial to latch new tools onto the system because all of that information would be consumable in a standard way. It would also make it quite a bit easier for each of the systems to talk to each other. Or, you could build a state- or country-wide system that was able to talk to each of the individual school systems to collect testing scores. The possibilities are endless.

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
> ***The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.***


Brother: `So this is what software developers work on now? Deciding how to best model the data?`

> ME: More or less, this is what engineers do when building APIs, thanks almost entirely to the popularity of RESTful web frameworks like Ruby on Rails, python's Django, and even what you can do with Express.JS.

> But this is a recent change! Just a few years ago, `the large majority of developers were busy writing layers of complex specifications for how to access data in a different way that isn't nearly as useful or eloquent`, known as SOAP. Nouns weren't universal and verbs weren't polymorphic. They basically ignored throwing out decades of real field `usage and proven technique and kept starting over with something that looks a lot like other systems` that have failed in the past. They used HTTP but only because it let them talk to our network and security people less. It was like trading simplicity for flashy tools and wizards.

### rother: Ew... Why?


### What does a GET do?
>***GET is used to request data from a specified resource.***



### What does PUT do?
> ***A PUT is used to update existing data at a given URL, or to create something new when you know what the URI is going to be and it doesn't already exist (as opposed to a POST which will create something and return a URL to it if necessary).***




### What does PATCH do?
> ***A patch is a set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches usually being called bugfixes or bug fixes.***
